Problem Statement and Objective: 
- Build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of the three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on the given features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.
- The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into their respective species—setosa, versicolor, or virginica—based on four measured features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Iris Dataset: 
- The Iris dataset consists of measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers. It includes three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. For each species, four features are measured, resulting in a total of 150 observations (50 samples from each species). The four features are:

    - Sepal Length: Length of the iris flower's sepals (the outermost whorl of a flower, usually green and protective).
    - Sepal Width: Width of the iris flower's sepals.
    - Petal Length: Length of the iris flower's petals (the innermost whorl of a flower, often colorful and attractive).
    - Petal Width: Width of the iris flower's petals.
    
- The dataset is available in many machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn in Python.
