# Iris-Dataset---Classification-
Build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of the three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on the given features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.
